I am Rahul; almuni of NIT Jaipur, IIM Bangalore and now a research scholar, in Quantitative Management area, at IIM Kozikhode. Have spent over 16 years of my life working in corporate and academia, though still passionate about working with data and trying new stuffs;). I worked with the likes of Satyam computers, Nokia Siemens and Deloitte Consulting but the urge to explore the uncharted territory led to few start-ups. Few failed and some saw the light of the day. Though not very successful in new ventures but lots of learnings!!!  Currently work as a Freelancer as well as a founding member of AwesomeStats Consulting; a company, run by few passionate folks, which is primarily focused towards trainings and consulting in the field of data science.

While working as a consultant at Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, I got a chance to work with some of the brightest minds in India. Under the guidance of [Prof. Dinesh Kumar U](https://www.iimb.ac.in/user/70/u-dinesh-kumar), I executed several analytics projects for large corporates. My work in the field of analytics includes predicting credit scoring for co-operative banks of Karnataka; predicting renege/attrition issue for fashion retail company; NPS for a reputed medical equipment manufacturer; predicting design issues for a leading US auto manufacturer; sales and warranty forecasting for a leading auto manufacturer; anomaly detection for a paper-based consumer products company based out of US.  One of the research engagements on fraud analytics & credit scoring model, funded by govt. of India, Ministry of Electronics and IT, fetched us a copyright(ROC: SW-11742/2018). 

Being associated with a reputed B-school opened channels for teaching as well. Over a period of 6 years, I have imparted 400 sessions in R/Python/Julia, as a guest faculty, at IIM Bangalore. As a freelancer, I have undertaken equivalent number of sessions for working professionals in various corporates. Few of the prominent corporate clients, I have worked with, include General Electric, Cisco, Deloitte Consulting, United Health Group, HSBC, Flipkart, Fidelity Investments, General Motors, JP Morgan, TVS Motors, Raukten, Hudson Bay etc. 

As a part of the [Data Centre and Analytics Lab, IIMB and Analytics society of India](https://dcal.iimb.ernet.in/analytics-society-india.html), I have also imparted several sessions in faculty developments programs in engineering and management institutions. I do have some publications and have also presented papers in several national and international conferences. Few of the prominent ones are:
