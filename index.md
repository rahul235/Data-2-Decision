## Decisions with Data

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the decisive expertise with applications across various industry domains. Machine learning (ML), which is a subset of AI, is an important set of algorithms used for solving several analytics problems. AI and ML are important skills that every graduate in engineering and management discipline will require to advance in their career. Companies across difference industries such as retail, finance, insurance, manufacturing, healthcare are planning to build and offer AI based solutions to stay competitive in the market. These companies will need a large pool of experts in the field of AI and ML to build products and solutions for them. An estimate by IDC (International Data Corporation) says that spending by organizations on AI and ML will grow from $12B in 2017 to $57.6 B in 2021 (Columbus, 2018). Almost 61% of organizations have reported that Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence will be among their top data initiatives in 2019. Machine Learning is going to be most in-demand AI skill for data scientists (Zafarino, 2018). An article in economic times in 2018 says Indiaâ€™s demand for data scientist grows by 400%, but in contrast the supply has only increase by 19% (Pramanik, 2018).

This site is an attempt to bring together resources which are useful to get started with machine learning. This is a repository for data science using Python R & Julia. The code files in this repository is used for explaining the basic concepts from machine learning. The datasets used in the code file are mostly from live cases worked out as a part of consulting engagement or research purpose.  Few links to the material are updated however the page is still in development and will be updated in due course.

### System Requirements 
One needs to have the below configurations for working on the projects using Python, R or Julia:

* Participants should bring their laptop (preferably Windows 7 or higher/ Mac OS installed). 
* Operating System (any of the following): 
> * Mac OS X with [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)
> * Windows (Version XP or later) is required. 
> * Minimum 16 GB RAM on the system is advisable.
