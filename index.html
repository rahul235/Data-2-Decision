Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the decisive expertise with applications across various industry domains. Machine learning (ML), which 
is a subset of AI, is an important set of algorithms used for solving several analytics problems. AI and ML are important skills that every graduate in 
engineering and management discipline will require to advance in their career. Companies across difference industries such as retail, finance, insurance, 
manufacturing, healthcare are planning to build and offer AI based solutions to stay competitive in the market. These companies will need a large pool of 
experts in the field of AI and ML to build products and solutions for them. An estimate by International Data Corporation (IDC) says that spending by 
organizations on AI and ML will grow from $12B in 2017 to $57.6 B in 2021. Almost 61% of organizations have reported that Machine Learning & Artificial 
Intelligence will be among their top data initiatives in 2019. Machine Learning is going to be most in-demand AI skill for data scientists. An article in 
economic times in 2018 says Indiaâ€™s demand for data scientist grows by 400%, but in contrast the supply has only increase by 19%.

This site is an attempt to bring together resources which are useful to get started with machine learning. This is a repository for data science using 
Python R & Julia. The code files in this repository is used for explaining the basic concepts from machine learning. The datasets used in the code file 
are mostly from live cases worked out as a part of consulting engagement or research purpose.  Links to the material are up-to-date however the embedded 
links may get modified/updated at any stage.
