## Context

ScaleneWorks People Solutions LLP (ScaleneWorks) has been a Bangalore based start-up that commenced its operations in the summer of 2010. ScaleneWorks 
was conceived by a team of HR practitioners comprising Sanjay Shelvankar, Ashish Tiwari, and Sharon George who had already scripted successful corporate
careers and were from three different areas of expertise such as technology consulting, talent acquisition and marketing. Their combined vision was to 
build an organization of great value and to position it among the most respected talent acquisition solutions providers globally within the next 5 years; 
this was reflected in the way they carefully chose their customers and engaged with them. ScaleneWorks considered itself to be the first true end-to-end 
talent acquisition solutions organization which had the passion to bring together decades of experience in technology consulting and talent acquisition area
s to usher in a paradigm shift in the way talent acquisition was practised in the existing ultra-demanding business environment. ScaleneWorks not only 
advised its customers on the status of talent acquisition practices, but also recommended and implemented individually tailored, viable solutions using analytics.
Business process re-engineering with its three tenets (i.e. people capability, process maturity, and technology adoption) formed the core ability of the 
company to provide customers with an enterprise-class customized solution to address their talent acquisition challenges. They brought in deep domain 
knowledge of how talent acquisition occurred in corporates and provided viable recommendations to its customers.

## Learning Objective

Client service is all about the quality of the people involved in delivering business. However, one of the major challenges for Sanjay and his clients revolved around managing a quality workforce. Organizations spend tremendous amount of time and energy to create a homogenous environment where people thrive and succeed. Despite all the efforts to maintain an environment that is conducive, people leave organizations in search of better opportunities. In order to fill the vacuum, HR is bound to recruit new talent, thus forming a vicious circle in between attrition and recruitment; and in order to mitigate this, organizations keep  trying to bridge the gap by strengthening their recruitment processes and creating a culture of inclusivity. However, scalene works wanted to go beyond the process  aspect of human resource management and evaluate analytics driven approach to answer the following:

1. What are the key drivers that influence the candidate joining/not-joining a company?
2. What rules can be used to predict the renege (candidates accepting the job offer and not joining)?
3. Devising a predictive algorithm to calculate the probability of acceptance of an offer and joining the company after offer acceptance stage.
