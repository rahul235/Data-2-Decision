It is not just business but our lives too have been swamped by data. A few instances being:

* The smart wearables which capuatres a pelthora of metrics. Some of them being, walking distance, resting heart rate, VO2 max, heart rate variablity etc.
* The health check-up lab reports wherein we can see the vitals such as cholestrol level, sugar level, thyriod level etc. over a period of time.
* The digial bank statements of credit/debit card spend for several years.
* The digtial purchase of items on BigBasket, BlinkIt, Amazon, Flipkart and the likes.

These data generated are not just for the consumption of business but also for us. We can prepare charts based on the data generated by the apps and platforms we use. Some of the charts, say, health trends in smart watch wearbales are easy to access. As data scientists and mostly with developer mideset, we tend to spend a lot of time building fancy charts using various packages in R and Python. Some of these charts like sunburst chart, heatmaps, treemaps shows the power of data visulaiztion. Offcourse, these charts help present data, succinctly. But at the same time, we seem to have mistaken data visualization just as an art of making fancy charts. The art does not lie in how complex the chart is, the art lies in telling the story behind those fancy charts. Those stories are not in "What data shows" but lies hideen in "Why it shows, what it shows"? To build this point, we will analyze the health data capatured by iWatch over a period of four years. It will be our story through the lens of data. Something which buisness can only wish they could know. These stories could generate insights which possibly could change our lifestyle habits. We can 


Here is a simple plot which shows the resting heart rate of a person. Its called as a lognitudinal data as it spans over a period of four years.
