## Context

The next time we hear that data is the new oil. Don't think only in context of business. Data is the oil which is touching our lives at a very personal level. A few instances being:

* The smart wearables which captures a plethora of metrics. Some of them being, walking distance, resting heart rate, VO2 max, heart rate variability etc.
* The health check-up lab reports wherein we can see the vitals such as cholesterol level, sugar level, thyroid level etc. over a period of time.
* The digital bank statements of credit/debit card spend for several years.
* The digital purchase of items on Big Basket, BlinkIt, Amazon, Flipkart and the likes.

These data generated are not just for the consumption of business but also for us. We can prepare charts based on the data generated by the apps and platforms we use. Some of the charts, say, health trends in smart wearables are easy to access. As data scientists and mostly with developer mindset, we tend to spend a lot of time building fancy charts using various packages in R and Python. Some of these charts like sunburst chart, heatmaps, tree maps shows the power of data visualization. Off course, these charts help present data, succinctly. But at the same time, we seem to have mistaken data visualization as an art of just making fancy charts. The art does not lie in how succinct the chart is; the art lies in story telling with data. These stories are not in "What data shows" but lies hidden in "Why it shows, what it shows"? To build this point, we will analyze the health data captured by iWatch over a period of four years. It will be our story through the lens of data. Something which business (including apple) can only wish they knew. The outcome of this analysis is the following:

* This story will bring up the point as to why we cannot make a good analysis unless we spent a significant amount of time in understanding the data.
* This story will generate insights which possibly could suggest the changes in lifestyle habits which certainly leads to fighting stress. In a way, the insights from here can applied to roughly speak about how the story may unfold for any other individual.
* This story may also answer the prevalence of heart attacks in younger generation in spite of seemingly being health conscious and hitting the gym regularly.  However, we do not claim it can be a generalized phenomena but just an indication of why things could not be right even for people who seem to be healthy.

## What is not a story
We know that the normal average heart rate of the individual is 72 BPM. Resting heart rate (RHR) is the heart beat per minute measured when the individual is active or relaxed for several minutes. Though the apple watch documentation suggests that, it does not measure RHR primarily during profound sleep but the data capture time shows these reading being taken during night (a period of less activity). The lower the resting heart rate, the better the cardiovascular fitness level of individual.  RHR can be improved by staying active, managing weight etc. Certain medication, like that of hypertension, keeps the heart rate low and thus the resting heart rate as well. Here is a simple plot which shows the resting heart rate of a person. It’s called as a longitudinal data as it spans over a period of time. The period  of data capture is aggregated at monthly level over a period of four year and thus making 48 observations (approx.). We can see the average heart beat for every year as well as the range in which the resting heart rate varied. It varied between 46 beats per minute (BPM) to 65 beats per minute over a period of four years. It hit the lowest in September 2020 and then there is a gradual increasing, hitting a high of 65 BPM in December 2022. This is “What” data shows. But is this a story? Does it even generate any insight?

The insights will come had we labeled the periods of ups and downs with the lifestyle followed by the individual. This is the hard part and is mostly missing in even the business level data visualization. This story can only be told by people who was the subject of this data and not by people who plotted the observations in a fancy chart. But before we get any further with the story, we will understand few metrics:

* Heart rate variability (HRV) is an interesting metric captured by iWatch. Assuming a normal heart rate of 60BPM does not imply that the heart is beating once every second. Within this window of one minute, there could be instance of 0.8 seconds between two beats and another instance of 1.5 seconds between the two beats. You can think of the two beats as spikes two spikes in ECG and the time between the two spikes as 0.80 seconds or 1.5 seconds. HRV is  measure of the variation in the time interval between beats. This HRV is measured by Apple watch using the standard deviation of beat-to-beat measurement i.e. variation in the values such as 0.80, 1.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.46…Higher the HRV the more relaxed the person is. Lower HRV depicts anxiety, stress. An HRV of 100 milliseconds (0.1 seconds) is considered really good. A value less than 50 milliseconds shows signs of anxiety and stress. Though it may seem that HRV will be more if resting heart rate is low but his is not the case always. The HRV is also an indication of the stability of the [nervous system](https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/heart-rate-variability-hrv/). The chart shows the HRV trend but as was the case with RHR; we only see the whats happening. It does not tell any story.

* VO2 max is another metric which measures the maximum amount of oxygen the body can consume while in period of intense exercise (say running/sprinting, hiking etc.). Higher the level of VO2 max, more is the cardiovascular fitness. It varies and generally goes down with age. The VO2 max of 35-45 mL/Kg/min may be considered average for a person in 35+ age group.

## What is a story

So how do we tell story!!! For that, we need to know the person and the life the person was leading. This is a story of a person whose name, co-incidentally, has got a lot of resemblance to my name. Rahul is a typical guy working in software with a very typical ad-hoc work time. Work hard, party harder is the mantra with which he lives. But as is the case with any IT professional with more than a decade of experience; the work pressure, office politics, family chores keeps him  on toes. The time to think about keeping track of health do come as a new year resolution but vanishes at equally faster rate. But the fondness for gadgets made him put some of his hard-earned money in buying lot of cool stuffs. The apple eco-system is a trap and he closed the loop with an iWatch. The constant nudges from watch is enough to make one guilty of not doing anything. So, Rahul decided to hit the road. In December 2018, he joined the cardio fitness program. A rather intensive work routine of “Crossfit training” from 6am-7am: 5 days a week. It was a program which not many could sustain for over two weeks. But at least the good part with Rahul was that he continued going without able to do most of the body weight exercises. It was embarrassing to not even able to do 5 push-ups. But this is when he realized how stale and unhealthy lifestyle he had.  His admiration for people who could do endurance exercises went up several notches. It took more than 3-4 months of regular regime to come at level with some of the best in the group. Post that, training looked simple, the body flexible and determination invincible. Off course he started wearing the smart watch more regularly like a maniac 24/7. The transformation not only led to making him more active but it reflected well on the attention span in work. This physical activity led to reaching a new height in the VO2 max.
