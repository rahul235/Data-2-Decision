It is not just in business but our lives too, have been swamped by data. A few instances being:

* The smart wearables which captures a plethora of metrics. Some of them being, walking distance, resting heart rate, VO2 max, heart rate variability etc.
* The health check-up lab reports wherein we can see the vitals such as cholesterol level, sugar level, thyroid level etc. over a period of time.
* The digital bank statements of credit/debit card spend for several years.
* The digital purchase of items on Big Basket, BlinkIt, Amazon, Flipkart and the likes.

These data generated are not just for the consumption of business but also for us. We can prepare charts based on the data generated by the apps and platforms we use. Some of the charts, say, health trends in smart wearables are easy to access. As data scientists and mostly with developer mindset, we tend to spend a lot of time building fancy charts using various packages in R and Python. Some of these charts like sunburst chart, heatmaps, tree maps shows the power of data visualization. Off course, these charts help present data, succinctly. But at the same time, we seem to have mistaken data visualization as an art of just making fancy charts. The art does not lie in how succinct the chart is; the art lies in story telling with data. These stories are not in "What data shows" but lies hidden in "Why it shows, what it shows"? To build this point, we will analyze the health data captured by iWatch over a period of four years. It will be our story through the lens of data. Something which business (including apple) can only wish they knew. These stories could generate insights which possibly could change the lifestyle habits. These stories may also answer the prevalence of heart attacks in younger generation in spite of seeming being health conscious and hitting the gym regularly.  

We know that the normal average heart rate of the individual is 72 BPM. Resting heart rate (RHR) is the heart beat per minute measured when the individual is active or relaxed for several minutes. Though the apple watch documentation suggests that, it does not measure RHR primarily during profound sleep but the data capture time shows these reading being taken during night (a period of less activity). The lower the resting heart rate, the better the cardiovascular fitness level of individual.  RHR can be improved by staying active, managing weight etc. Certain medication, like that of hypertension, keeps the heart rate low and thus the resting heart rate as well. Here is a simple plot which shows the resting heart rate of a person. It’s called as a longitudinal data as it spans over a period of time. The period  of data capture is aggregated at monthly level over a period of four year and thus making 48 observations (approx.). We can see the average heart beat for every year as well as the range in which the resting heart rate varied. It varied between 46 beats per minute (BPM) to 65 beats per minute over a period of four years. It hit the lowest in September 2020 and then there is a gradual increasing, hitting a high of 65 BPM in December 2022. This is “What” data shows. But is this a story? Does it even generate any insight?

The insights will come had we labeled the periods of ups and downs with the lifestyle followed by the individual. This is the hard part and is mostly missing in even the business level data visualization. This story can only be told by people who was the subject of this data and not by people who plotted the observations in a fancy chart. But before we get any further with the story, we will understand few metrics:

* Heart rate variability (HRV) is an interesting metric captured by iWatch. Assuming a normal heart rate of 60BPM does not imply that the heart is beating once every second. Within this window of one minute, there could be instance of 0.8 seconds between two beats and another instance of 1.5 seconds between the two beats. You can think of the two beats as spikes two spikes in ECG and the time between the two spikes as 0.80 seconds or 1.5 seconds. HRV is  measure of the variation in the time interval between beats. This HRV is measured by Apple watch using the standard deviation of beat-to-beat measurement i.e. variation in the values such as 0.80, 1.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.46…Higher the HRV the more relaxed the person is. Lower HRV depicts anxiety, stress. An HRV of 100 milliseconds (0.1 seconds) is considered really good. A value less than 50 milliseconds shows signs of anxiety and stress. Though it may seem that HRV will be more if resting heart rate is low but his is not the case always. The HRV is also an indication of the stability of the nervous system.  https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/heart-rate-variability-hrv/

* VO2 max is another metric which measures the maximum amount of oxygen the body can consume while in period of intense exercise (say running/sprinting, hiking etc.). Higher the level of VO2 max, more is the cardiovascular fitness. It varies and generally goes down with age. The VO2 max of 35-45 mL/Kg/min may be considered average for a person in 35+ age group.
